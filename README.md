## Description

A web application to give you information about different countries in the world. This application combines my passion for coding and travelling.

You can :

- See the countries that I have been.
- Get information about different countries across the globe.
- Create your own imaginary countries.
- Delete your own imaginary countries.

I am going to add more functionality soon so that you can have your own data about country that you have been!üòÅ
